# bot/ — headless environment for forceteki

Runs the real rules engine with no server, sockets, lobby or login, so bots can play it.

Run from the **swu_bot repo root** (the engine submodule `forceteki/` needs `npm install`, `npm run get-cards` and `npm run build` done first):

    node bot/random-run.js [numGames] [startSeed] [maxSteps]
    node bot/debug-seed.js <seed>        # replay one seed and dump the context if it errors

## Files
- `env.js` — `Env` (card data, random deck builder) and `EnvGame` (`start()`, `legalActions(pid)`, `apply(pid, action)`).
  Actions are plain objects: `button`, `card`, `option`, `displayCard`, `perCardButton`, `distribute`.
- `random-run.js` — random-vs-random games; prints per-game outcome, games/sec and the prompt shapes it saw.
- `debug-seed.js` — replays one seed deterministically and prints the last actions and prompt state on failure.

## Notes
- Games are reproducible: engine RNG is seeded via `game.setRandomSeed`, bot choices via `seededRng`.
- Engine input rules learned the hard way: the distribute-damage prompt's `Done` button is *not* a menu click
  (it is sent via `statefulPromptResults`); in "cards with buttons" prompts only the per-card buttons are legal;
  indirect damage on a unit may not exceed its remaining HP.
- Undo/snapshots are disabled by default (`newGame({ undo: true })` enables `UndoMode.Full` for search experiments).
